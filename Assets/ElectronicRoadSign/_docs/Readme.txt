[Usage]
The prefabs are all ready to go, just drag one into your scene. 

For the ElectronicRoadSign, in the inspector, you can change the display text, display cycle time, and delay between screen changes. Long text is automatically split up into separate lines and screens and the pipe "|" character works as a line break.

Here is a list of the displayable characters:

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!$^()-+=<>?,./:'*_\"#;[]{}%&

All other characters are displayed as blanks.

Hint: The display is 3 lines with 8 characters per line. You will have best results using words that are 8 letters or less, although longer words will be automatically split and wrapped to the next line.

Likewise, for the ElectronicArrowSign, you can change the sign mode, on time and off time in the inspector.
