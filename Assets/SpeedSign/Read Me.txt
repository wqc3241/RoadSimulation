 (based on Unity version that you are using) there is an old version of the cinematic post-processing effect that used in the test scene.
 the material of LED has emission and that makes the LEDs look glowing.
 So, if you are using any other addons for that purpose, you can delete the Folder called "Standard Assets", also, make sure to delete it's contained files and folders too. 
 you can find it from this path: "/Assets/SpeedSign/".
